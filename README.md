# WinMoE

**Running Qwen3.5-397B (397 billion parameters) on a consumer Windows laptop at 1.9 tok/s.**

This project adapts Apple's ["LLM in a Flash"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11514) concepts and Dan Woods' [Flash-MoE](https://github.com/danveloper/flash-moe) (Mac/Metal) to Windows with discrete GPU, proving that SSD-streamed MoE inference is viable on consumer hardware.

## Results

| Configuration | tok/s | Hardware |
|--------------|-------|----------|
| Qwen3.5-397B, K=10, CPU cold | 0.44 | RTX 3070 Laptop 8GB, 40GB DDR4, Samsung 980 NVMe |
| Qwen3.5-397B, K=3, source-built AVX512 | **1.8** | Same |
| Qwen3.5-397B, K=3, source-built CUDA ngl=8 | **1.9** | Same |
| iPhone 17 Pro (reference) | 0.6 | Apple A19 Pro, 12GB unified |
| Flash-MoE Mac (reference) | 4.36 | M3 Max 48GB, 17.5 GB/s SSD |

**4.3x improvement** from 0.44 to 1.9 tok/s through systematic optimization — K reduction, GPU layer tuning, thread optimization, compiler upgrades — with no custom inference engine.

## Key Findings

1. **MoE expert streaming works on Windows** — a 397B model (107 GB at IQ2_XXS) runs interactively on a laptop with 40GB RAM and 8GB VRAM
2. **The bottleneck is I/O, not compute** — explicit unbuffered reads achieve 2,200 MB/s vs mmap's 586 MB/s (3.7x faster)
3. **K reduction is the most impactful lever** — reducing active experts from 10 to 3 with minimal quality loss at 2-bit quantization
4. **GPU offload is second-order** — only +6.6% improvement, confirming SSD I/O dominance
5. **Throughput improves with generation length** — page cache warming gives +24% free speedup
6. **Compute ceiling is 2.34 tok/s** — professor-validated formula: `TPS_max = 1 / (L × T_c)` at K=3

## How It Works

Mixture-of-Experts models activate only a fraction of their parameters per token. Qwen3.5-397B has 512 experts per layer but only uses 3-10 per token. This means most expert weights can live on SSD and stream into RAM/GPU on demand:

```
SSD (107 GB model) → RAM (expert cache) → GPU (active computation)
         ↑                    ↑                     ↑
    2.1 GB/s            19 GB/s              192 GB/s
    (bottleneck)        (fast)               (fast)
```

## Methodology

This project uses an **AI-driven autoresearch** approach inspired by [Karpathy's autoresearch](https://github.com/karpathy/autoresearch):

- Claude Code (Opus 4.6) runs as the autonomous research agent
- Each optimization is a single experiment: one change, one measurement, keep or reject
- All results tracked in append-only TSV ledgers
- Professor provides formal mathematical guidance on architecture decisions
- The V2 spec defines measurement tracks A-G with explicit gate criteria

## Key Experiments

### Hardware Characterization
- SSD I/O benchmark: explicit unbuffered (2.1 GB/s) vs mmap (586 MB/s) vs buffered (6.8 GB/s cached)
- PCIe transfer: pinned (19 GB/s) vs pageable (6-8 GB/s)
- Affine timing models: `t(x,m) = α + βm + x/B`

### Routing Trace Analysis
- OLMoE real inference: Zipf s=0.456, Gini=0.396, 37.5% consecutive overlap
- Gate-weight analysis: Zipf s=0.275 (synthetic inputs — conservative lower bound)
- Working set covers 96% of experts by 1000 tokens

### Cache Simulation
- Static LFU >> LRU (confirmed by professor)
- Tiered cache: VRAM (64% hit) + RAM (31% hit) + SSD (5% miss) = 95% combined
- Miss curve: `M(C) ≈ 1 - (C^0.54 - 1) / (512^0.54 - 1)`

### Quality Frontier
- K=3, K=4, K=5 all produce coherent output at IQ2_XXS quantization
- At 2-bit, quantization noise dominates expert-count noise (professor-confirmed)

### Custom Engine Benchmarks
- Explicit I/O: 3.7x faster than mmap on expert-sized blocks
- Integrated benchmark: projects 2.34 tok/s with pipeline overlap
- Page cache pre-staging: fails due to NVMe queue contention (professor-explained)

## Professor-Validated Theory

The professor provided rigorous answers with exact formulas. Key results:

- **Compute ceiling**: `TPS_max ≈ 1 / (L × T_c) = 2.34 tok/s` at K=3
- **I/O crossover**: `B_crossover = K × S_e / T_c = 1.39 GB/s` — explicit I/O (2.1 GB/s) is above crossover
- **NVMe contention**: supplementing mmap always degrades (M/G/1-PS model)
- **Cache cliff**: smooth miss curve, not phase transition — kink comes from `max(compute, I/O)`
- **Hardware ROI**: (1) replace mmap, (2) improve GPU compute, (3) faster SSD (last priority)
- **Prediction**: dead end — label entropy ~24.4 bits makes Fano bound prohibitive
